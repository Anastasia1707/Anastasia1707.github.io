## ABOUT ME |

My name is Anastasia. I am a Data Scientist and an Economist with experience in predictive analytics, machine learning, and macroeconomic research across industry, government, and academia. I am passionate about working with data – discovering patterns and anomalies, extracting meaningful insights, and applying machine learning and advanced statistics to solve real-world problems.

My background bridges data science and economics, combining technical expertise with an understanding of large-scale systems and decision-making. Professionally, I have worked in applied R&D predictive analytics and machine learning for medical technology manufacturing, as well as in macroeconomic research and policy analysis for the Department of Economy and the National Analytical Center of Kazakhstan. My research collaborations include projects with experts from Duke University, the Centennial Group, and the World Bank on topics of global value chains and oil wealth management.

Today, I’m particularly excited about cross-disciplinary applications of machine learning that connect data science with knowlwdge domains in healthcare, economics, and manufacturing. I continuously expand my skills in Python, big data, probabilistic modeling, and data visualization (Tableau certified), and I’m eager to contribute to impactful, data-driven projects that translate analysis into meaningful outcomes.

Beyond data, I’m also passionate about music and creativity. In my spare time, I play the piano and am developing a machine learning tool to predict piano fingerings for sheet music, contributing to the open-source music data community.
